# OneSquareInchOfPB
ATmega328PB TQFP breakout.  This is the new chip, not the one on the Arduino
Uno.  Board design based on the "One Square Inch of Goodness" by Jeremy
Saglimbeni, found at https://github.com/jersagfast/One-Square-Inch-of-Goodness

The main difference is that this board uses the ATmega 328PB chip, which is
a bit different from the 328P used in the Arduino Uno.  I have also added a
pair of header pins for the PE0 and PE1 signals, which are handy to use for
their secondary I2C capability.  Thirdly, some capacitors on the VCC line.
